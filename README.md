Hello If You Need Assistance then here you go:

addf(): writes in a file

readf(): read a file

delf(): delete a file

Note: Restoref doesn't work but I am working on it

binf(): bins a file

startf(): makes a file

terminatef(): stops terminal

renamef(): renames file
Note: You Cannot rename a file if is binned

Hope You Have Fun Bye :)
